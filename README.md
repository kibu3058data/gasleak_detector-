This project was used in a reputed oil refinery company for detecting gas leak from valves and flanges


# Gas Leak Detector * When gases are detected, the GSM900a sends users an alert/message before the circuit breaker trips.

# Hardware * 1 x Rgb led * RGB LED stands for red, blue, and green LEDs. RGB LED lighting products combine these three colours to produce over 16 million different light hues.
* GSM SIM900a * The SIM900A is a GSM module that functions similarly to a phone. It can send a message, call a phone number, and send data via GPRS.
* Arduino Uno * The Arduino UNO is an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc that is based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller.
* MQ-6 Gas Sensor * The MQ-6 Gas sensor can detect and measure gases such as LPG and butane.
* Relay * A type of switch that is commonly used in switching circuits.
* Circuit Breaker * A device that is commonly used in switching circuits.
